# Toxic_Comment_Classifer_CSCI3202

How to run this code:

In your console, simply run the python file labeled "bayes_classifer.py". This will train the Naive Bayes model, and then test it on the provided data set. The default amount of sentences to test is 20,000, which can be changed by modifying num_test_texts in main. I recommended only setting this value to 50-1000, as it takes about 3 minutes to run through 1000 sentences. 


python bayes_classifier.py
